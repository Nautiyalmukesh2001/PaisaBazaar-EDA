        "### **Introduction:**\n",
        "Paisa Bazaar, a prominent financial services platform, is tasked with accurately assessing customer creditworthiness and identifying fraudulent activities. Misclassification of credit scores leads to increased loan defaults, suboptimal financial product recommendations, and revenue losses. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project aims to enhance credit risk assessment, fraud detection, and personalized financial services by leveraging customer financial and behavioral data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Business Problem:**\n",
        "The challenge is to extract actionable insights from a dataset of 100,000 records with 28 features, representing diverse financial and behavioral attributes like income, loans, delayed payments, and credit utilization. Key objectives include:\n",
        "- Minimizing loan default risks.\n",
        "- Detecting and preventing fraudulent activities.\n",
        "- Improving personalized financial recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Methodology:**\n",
        "The project employed a systematic approach to analyze and address business challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Preparation:**\n",
        "   - Cleaned the dataset to ensure no missing or duplicate values and standardized variable names.\n",
        "   - Validated critical features like SSN, age groups, and credit mixes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering:**\n",
        "   - Created derived variables such as \"SSN Validity,\" \"Salary Discrepancy,\" \"High-Risk Loan Flag,\" and \"Expected Monthly Salary.\"\n",
        "   - Analyzed financial behaviors, credit utilization, and demographic patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**\n",
        "   - Used visualizations, statistical analysis, and correlations to uncover key insights.\n",
        "   - Developed charts to analyze relationships between delayed payments, outstanding debt, and credit scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Insights Extraction:**\n",
        "   - Investigated patterns across demographic groups, payment behaviors, and credit profiles.\n",
        "   - Highlighted potential red flags for fraud and risky financial behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Actionable Recommendations:**\n",
        "   - Proposed targeted strategies for fraud detection, risk mitigation, and product personalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Assumptions:**\n",
        "The analysis was based on the following assumptions:\n",
        "1. **Data Quality:** The dataset is accurate, representative, and free from biases or inaccuracies.\n",
        "2. **SSN Validity:** Invalid SSNs indicate fraud risks or administrative errors, correlated with poor credit scores.\n",
        "3. **Salary Discrepancies:** Higher discrepancies signify potential financial mismanagement or reporting errors.\n",
        "4. **Credit Mix:** Good credit mix reflects financial stability, while bad credit mix is linked to higher defaults.\n",
        "5. **Demographics:** Age groups and occupations influence credit risk and financial behaviors.\n",
        "6. **Loan Behavior:** Customers with many loans or credit cards exhibit higher financial risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Dataset Details:**\n",
        "- **Size:** 100,000 rows, 28 features.\n",
        "- **Content:** Includes variables like income, loan counts, credit utilization, delayed payments, and payment behavior.\n",
        "- **Quality:** Clean, with no missing or duplicate values and no significant outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Insights:**\n",
        "1. **Fraud Indicators:**\n",
        "   - 21.6% of SSNs flagged as invalid, suggesting potential fraud or data issues.\n",
        "   - High-risk behaviors found among customers with excessive loans or credit cards.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Credit Score Patterns:**\n",
        "   - Standard credit scores dominate (53%), followed by Poor (29%) and Good (18%).\n",
        "   - Poor scores correlate with delayed payments, high debt, and bad credit mixes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Demographics:**\n",
        "   - Young adults (25–33) and middle-aged adults (34–42) show stronger credit profiles.\n",
        "   - Younger customers (14–24) are more prone to risky financial behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Financial Behaviors:**\n",
        "   - Delayed payments and outstanding debt are strongly correlated with poor credit scores.\n",
        "   - Customers with 6+ credit cards or high salary discrepancies exhibit higher financial risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Visualization Highlights:**\n",
        "1. **Credit Score Analysis:**\n",
        "   - Pie charts and histograms show the distribution of credit scores and age demographics.\n",
        "   - Delayed payments and credit utilization ratios reveal clear risk thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Risk Identification:**\n",
        "   - Heatmaps highlight strong correlations between outstanding debt, delayed payments, and credit utilization ratios.\n",
        "   - Dual-axis charts uncover trends in loan behaviors, financial strain, and repayment delays.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Demographic Trends:**\n",
        "   - Young people with invalid loan profiles or bad credit mixes are flagged for fraud risks.\n",
        "   - Older adults (43–56) show higher debt but stable repayment behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Actionable Recommendations:**\n",
        "1. **Fraud Detection:**\n",
        "   - Strengthen SSN validation processes and flag high-risk behaviors (e.g., excessive loans).\n",
        "   - Monitor credit card ownership to identify over-leveraged customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Risk Mitigation:**\n",
        "   - Incorporate delayed payments and salary discrepancies into risk models.\n",
        "   - Target high-debt customers with debt consolidation programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Personalized Products:**\n",
        "   - Offer premium loans for high-income, good-credit customers.\n",
        "   - Provide low-risk products for poor-credit, low-income customers to build creditworthiness.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Interest Rate Policies:**\n",
        "   - Adjust interest rates for high-risk profiles to reduce defaults.\n",
        "   - Incentivize good credit mixes with lower interest rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Education and Engagement:**\n",
        "   - Educate young adults (14–24) on financial planning and credit management.\n",
        "   - Provide counseling for customers with severe financial discrepancies.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion:**\n",

        "\n",
        "**Manipulations which have Done:**\n",
        "1. Renaming Columns for Better Clarity:\n",
        "The \"Credit Score\" column was renamed to \"Credit Score Category\" to better represent the values (e.g., Good, Bad, Standard) and make it more intuitive for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Formatting the 'Month' Column:\n",
        "The \"Month\" column, which had numerical values (1-8), was converted into month names (e.g., January, February) to improve readability and provide better insights when analyzing monthly trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Validating SSN (Social Security Number):\n",
        "*   A function was created to check the validity of the SSN for each customer. A new column, \"SSN Validity\", was added to indicate whether the SSN was valid or invalid.\n",
        "*   The distribution of valid and invalid SSNs was analyzed to detect any anomalies or potential data issues related to fraud.\n",
        "*   The relationship between SSN validity and the credit score was analyzed to check if there was any correlation between the two, particularly to identify if invalid SSNs were associated with poor credit scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Comparing Credit Score and Annual Income:\n",
        "The Credit Score was compared with the Annual Income of customers to investigate any patterns between income levels and credit score categories, which could reveal insights into financial behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Creating Salary-Related Columns:\n",
        " A new column, \"Expected Monthly Salary,\" was created based on each customer's reported annual income. Additionally, two new columns—\"Monthly Salary Discrepancy\" and \"Percentage Discrepancy\"—were introduced to highlight the differences between the expected and reported monthly salaries. To further enhance the analysis, a function was developed to categorize these discrepancies, enabling later exploration of their relationship with other variables.This discrepancy can be visualized to identify outliers and investigate potential fraudulent activities or data inconsistencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Cleaning 'Credit Mix' Column:\n",
        "The values in the \"Credit Mix\" column were adjusted to make them more understandable, e.g., changing “Good” to “Good Credit Mix”. This transformation helped make the analysis of credit behavior more meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Categorizing Customer Age:\n",
        "A function was created to categorize the raw age data into age categories (e.g., 14-23, 24-35, etc.), allowing for more effective segmentation and better analysis of how credit score correlates with different age groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Extracting Unique Loan Types:\n",
        "A function was used to extract unique loan types from the \"Types of Loan\" column where multiple loan types were listed. This allowed for the analysis of individual loan types and their distribution across the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Identifying Fraudulent Behavior Based on Occupation and Loan Type:\n",
        "*   Upon examining the unique occupations in the dataset, it was found that the term \"Student\" was missing, yet student loans were listed. A function was created to identify any occupation that might be incorrectly associated with student loans, leading to a new column for categorizing valid and invalid student loans.\n",
        "*  The validity of these loans was analyzed  and compared with age categories to understand any age-related patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. High-Risk Loan Flag Based on Age:\n",
        "*   A function was developed to flag individuals in the age group 14-23 who had taken mortgage loans, home equity loans, or personal loans, as these types of loans are unusual for this age group and could suggest fraudulent behavior. A new column, \"High-Risk Loan Flag\", was created to categorize loans as either \"Red Flag\" or \"No Red Flag\".\n",
        "*   The distribution of red flag loans was compared against credit score categories and credit utilization ratios to identify any patterns that suggest a higher likelihood of fraud.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Insights Found:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*  The data reveals that 21.6% of records have an invalid SSN, which could be a potential red flag for fraud risk. Individuals with a valid SSN dominate across all credit score categories, especially in the \"Standard\" category, which accounts for over half of the dataset. The prevalence of valid SSNs in higher credit score categories suggests a correlation between data reliability and creditworthiness. This distribution indicates the need for further investigation into the potential relationship between SSN validity and fraudulent activity, particularly within the \"Poor\" and \"Standard\" credit score groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  The data reveals that most customers have \"Minimal Discrepancy\" in salary, linked to better (\"Standard\") credit scores. As salary discrepancies increase, credit scores worsen, especially for those in \"High\" or \"Severe Discrepancy\" groups. Additionally, higher discrepancies correlate with greater outstanding debt, indicating increased financial risk and potential for fraud concerns.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  The analysis of the credit score categories shows distinct financial characteristics. The \"Good\" category has the highest mean value (65,203.67) and a wider range of variation, suggesting a strong financial profile but also higher dispersion, which might warrant further scrutiny for outliers or inconsistencies. The \"Poor\" category has the lowest mean (40,584.52) and a smaller range, indicating more concentrated, lower financial values. The \"Standard\" category falls in between, with a moderate mean (50,987.16) and distribution. These differences emphasize the potential for fraud analysis by comparing data spread and variability across credit categories to identify unusual patterns or outliers that could indicate fraudulent behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  The comparison of credit score categories highlights key differences in financial behavior. Individuals in the \"Good\" category have a slightly higher credit utilization ratio (33%) and fewer credit cards (4 on average), loans (2), and credit inquiries (3), indicating responsible credit management. The \"Poor\" category shows a higher average number of credit cards (7), loans (5), and credit inquiries (8), suggesting potential financial instability or a higher risk profile. The \"Standard\" group is moderate across all variables, but with elevated credit inquiries (5) compared to the \"Good\" category. These patterns are crucial for fraud analysis, as a high number of credit inquiries or loans might flag risky or potentially fraudulent financial activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Individuals with a Bad Credit Mix are more likely to have Poor credit scores (14,289 out of 23,768), suggesting that poor credit mix is a risk factor for low creditworthiness. In contrast, a Good Credit Mix is strongly associated with Good credit scores (14,848 out of 30,384), indicating that a favorable credit mix often corresponds with higher creditworthiness. The Standard Credit Mix has a more balanced distribution but is concentrated in the Standard credit score category (33,361 out of 45,848). These insights are useful for identifying patterns in credit risk and may help detect profiles with a higher likelihood of fraud based on credit mix and score categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  The data reveals that middle-aged (34-42) and young adults (25-33) have the highest counts of good and standard credit mixes, indicating stronger credit profiles. Older adults (43-56) also show a stable good credit mix. However, young people (14-24) exhibit a higher bad credit mix, signaling potential credit risk. In terms of delayed payments, most age groups (14-42) average 14 delays, while older adults average 11, suggesting similar risk profiles for younger and middle-aged groups, with slightly lower risk in older adults. These insights can help target high-risk groups for credit improvement and fraud prevention strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   There is a notable presence of “Invalid” loan profiles (associated with student loans) among all age groups, especially in the “Poor” credit score category. Middle-aged adults (34-42) and young adults (25-33) with poor credit scores show a particularly high count of invalid loan profiles. This trend suggests that individuals in these age groups with poor credit scores might be at higher risk for credit issues, and the presence of invalid loan profiles could signal potential red flags for fraud detection. Identifying these patterns can help in refining risk assessment and detecting potentially fraudulent loan profiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The analysis reveals that most loans have no red flags, with lower risk generally associated with good and standard credit scores. Poor credit scores show a higher proportion of red flags, indicating greater risk. Key risk indicators include more delayed payments, higher outstanding debt, and increased credit inquiries in red-flagged cases. Credit utilization appears consistent, but longer credit histories are linked to lower risk. Payment behaviors, like paying only the minimum amount, may also influence risk assessment.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The analysis reveals as the number of loans (Num_of_Loan) increases, the Monthly_Inhand_Salary generally decreases. Additionally, a higher number of loans correlates with more Num_of_Delayed_Payment and Num_Credit_Inquiries, as well as a higher Outstanding_Debt. This trend may indicate increased financial strain or risk among individuals with multiple loans, which could be relevant for assessing creditworthiness and the likelihood of fraud. For example, individuals with 8-9 loans show significantly higher outstanding debt and delayed payments, suggesting they may have lower credit scores and higher risk factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Higher numbers of credit cards are associated with lower credit scores, more credit inquiries, and slightly reduced credit utilization ratios. People with 8+ cards generally fall into poorer credit categories and have many inquiries, indicating potential financial strain or credit risk. This information is valuable for assessing credit score and identifying potential fraud risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   From this data, we observe a general upward trend in outstanding debt as the number of bank accounts increases. This pattern could indicate that individuals with more bank accounts tend to carry higher debt, possibly affecting their credit score and fraud risk. The steep increase in debt after five bank accounts suggests a potential threshold, which might be relevant for identifying high-risk profiles. This trend could be an indicator to monitor for potential creditworthiness and fraud likelihood in credit score and fraud analysis.\n",

Additionally, Monthly Balance shows a negative relationship with Outstanding Debt and Total EMI per Month, reflecting the impact of high financial obligations on liquidity.
